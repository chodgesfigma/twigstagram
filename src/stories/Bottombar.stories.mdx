# Bottombar Component

The `Bottombar` component is a shared component used in the Twigstagram application. It is designed to be displayed at the bottom of the screen and provides navigation links to various sections of the app.




## Example

Here is an example of how the `Bottombar` component looks and functions:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    {() => (
      <div>
        <style>{`
          .bottom-bar {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: space-between;
            width: 100%;
            position: sticky;
            bottom: 0;
            background-color: #09090A; /* Update with your dark-2 color from Tailwind CSS */
            padding: 1rem 2rem;
          }
        `}</style>
        <QueryClientProvider client={new QueryClient()}>
          <MemoryRouter>
            <Bottombar />
          </MemoryRouter>
        </QueryClientProvider>
      </div>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>


## Usage

To use the `Bottombar` component in your project, you need to wrap it with `QueryClientProvider` and `MemoryRouter`. Below is an example of how to include it in your application.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Bottombar from '@/components/shared/Bottombar';
import { MemoryRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

const App = () => (
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <MemoryRouter>
      <Bottombar />
    </MemoryRouter>
  </QueryClientProvider>
);
export default App;
```

## Style Guidelines

When implementing the `Bottombar` component, it is important to adhere to certain style guidelines to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the application. Below are some recommended style guidelines:

### Consistency

- **Colors:** Use the defined color palette for all elements in the `Bottombar`. This includes the background color, text color, and icon colors. Ensure that the colors match the overall theme of the application. For example, use `bg-dark-2` for the background color and `text-light-1` for text.
- **Typography:** Use the `Inter` font family, as specified in your global CSS. Apply appropriate text classes such as `.base-medium` or `.small-semibold` for consistent typography.

### Spacing and Alignment

- **Padding and Margin:** Maintain consistent padding and margin values around the navigation items. Use utility classes like `px-5` and `py-4` for padding to ensure the `Bottombar` looks balanced and the items are not too close or too far apart.
- **Alignment:** Ensure that all navigation items are properly aligned, both horizontally and vertically. Use flexbox properties such as `flex-between` and `items-center` to achieve consistent alignment.

### Responsiveness

- **Mobile-Friendly:** The `Bottombar` should be fully responsive and work well on various screen sizes, including mobile devices. Use utility classes like `md:hidden` to manage visibility and ensure touch targets are appropriately sized for easy interaction on touch screens.
- **Viewport Width:** Make sure the `Bottombar` spans the entire width of the viewport and stays fixed at the bottom, regardless of the screen size. Use `w-full` and `sticky bottom-0` classes to achieve this.

### Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that the `Bottombar` is accessible via keyboard navigation. Users should be able to navigate through the items using the Tab key.
- **Aria Labels:** Use appropriate ARIA labels for the navigation items to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- **Contrast:** Maintain sufficient contrast between the text and the background color to ensure readability. Ensure compliance with accessibility standards by using high-contrast color combinations like `text-light-1` on `bg-dark-2`.

### Interactions

- **Hover and Focus States:** Define clear hover and focus states for interactive elements in the `Bottombar`. This provides visual feedback to users and enhances the overall user experience. Use classes like `hover:bg-primary-500` and `focus-visible:ring-1` to style these states.
- **Active State:** Highlight the active or selected navigation item to indicate the current section of the application the user is in. Use a distinct style, such as `bg-primary-600`, to denote the active state.

### Customization

- **Theming:** Allow for easy customization and theming of the `Bottombar`. Developers should be able to override default styles to match their application's branding. Ensure the component is styled using utility classes that can be easily adjusted.
- **Component Overrides:** Provide options to override specific styles or components within the `Bottombar` to cater to unique use cases without compromising the overall design integrity.

### Example CSS

Here is the CSS used for styling the `Bottombar` component, incorporating the styles and utilities from your global CSS:

```css
.bottom-bar {
  @apply z-50 flex-between w-full sticky bottom-0 rounded-t-[20px] bg-dark-2 px-5 py-4 md:hidden;
}
```
