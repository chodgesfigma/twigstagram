# Label Component

The `Label` component is a versatile label element used in the Twigstagram application. It supports various states, including default and disabled.

## Example

Here are examples of how the `Label` component looks and functions:

<Canvas>
  <Story name="DefaultLabel">
    {() => <Label>Label Text</Label>}
  </Story>
  <Story name="DisabledLabel">
    {() => <Label disabled>Label Text (Disabled)</Label>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage

To use the `Label` component in your project, you can import it and use it with the desired props. Below is an example of how to include it in your application.

```jsx
"use client"

import * as React from "react"
import * as LabelPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-label"
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority"

import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

const labelVariants = cva(
  "text-sm font-medium leading-none peer-disabled:cursor-not-allowed peer-disabled:opacity-70"
)

const Label = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof LabelPrimitive.Root>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof LabelPrimitive.Root> &
    VariantProps<typeof labelVariants>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <LabelPrimitive.Root
    ref={ref}
    className={cn(labelVariants(), className)}
    {...props}
  />
))
Label.displayName = LabelPrimitive.Root.displayName

export { Label }

```

## Style Guidelines

When implementing the `Label` component, it is important to adhere to certain style guidelines to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the application. Below are some recommended style guidelines:

### Consistency

- **Colors:** Use the defined color palette for all elements in the `Label`. Ensure that the colors match the overall theme of the application.
- **Typography:** Use the `Inter` font family, as specified in your global CSS. Apply appropriate text classes for consistent typography.

### Spacing and Alignment

- **Padding and Margin:** Maintain consistent padding and margin values. Use utility classes to ensure the `Label` looks balanced.
- **Alignment:** Ensure that all elements within the `Label` are properly aligned, both horizontally and vertically.

### Responsiveness

- **Mobile-Friendly:** The `Label` should be fully responsive and work well on various screen sizes.
- **Viewport Width:** Make sure the `Label` spans the appropriate width for its context.

### Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that the `Label` is accessible via keyboard navigation.
- **Aria Labels:** Use appropriate ARIA labels for the label elements to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- **Contrast:** Maintain sufficient contrast between the text and the background color to ensure readability.

### Interactions

- **Hover and Focus States:** Define clear hover and focus states for interactive elements. Use utility classes to style these states.
- **Active State:** Highlight the active or selected state to indicate the current action.

### Customization

- **Theming:** Allow for easy customization and theming of the `Label`. Ensure the component is styled using utility classes that can be easily adjusted.
- **Component Overrides:** Provide options to override specific styles or components within the `Label` to cater to unique use cases without compromising the overall design integrity.
### Example CSS

Here is the CSS used for styling the `Label` component, incorporating the styles and utilities from your global CSS:

```css
.text-sm {
  @apply text-sm;
}
.font-medium {
  @apply font-medium;
}
.leading-none {
  @apply leading-none;
}
.peer-disabled\:cursor-not-allowed {
  @apply cursor-not-allowed;
}
.peer-disabled\:opacity-70 {
  @apply opacity-70;
}
```
