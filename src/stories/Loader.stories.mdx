# Loader Component

The `Loader` component is used to display a loading spinner in the Twigstagram application. It provides a visual indication that content is being loaded or processed.


## Usage

To use the `Loader` component in your project, you can import it and use it with the desired props. Below is an example of how to include it in your application.

```jsx
const Loader = () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex-center w-full">
        <img
            src="/assets/icons/loader.svg"
            alt="loader"
            width={24}
            height={24}
        />
    </div>
  )
}

export default Loader;
```

## Style Guidelines

When implementing the `Loader` component, it is important to adhere to certain style guidelines to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the application. Below are some recommended style guidelines:

### Consistency

- **Colors:** Use the defined color palette for all elements in the `Loader`. Ensure that the colors match the overall theme of the application.
- **Typography:** Use the `Inter` font family, as specified in your global CSS. Apply appropriate text classes for consistent typography.

### Spacing and Alignment

- **Padding and Margin:** Maintain consistent padding and margin values. Use utility classes to ensure the `Loader` looks balanced.
- **Alignment:** Ensure that all elements within the `Loader` are properly aligned, both horizontally and vertically.

### Responsiveness

- **Mobile-Friendly:** The `Loader` should be fully responsive and work well on various screen sizes.
- **Viewport Width:** Make sure the `Loader` spans the appropriate width for its context.

### Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that the `Loader` is accessible via keyboard navigation.
- **Aria Labels:** Use appropriate ARIA labels for the loader to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- **Contrast:** Maintain sufficient contrast between the loader and the background color to ensure visibility.

### Interactions

- **Hover and Focus States:** Define clear hover and focus states for interactive elements. Use utility classes to style these states.
- **Active State:** Highlight the active or selected state to indicate the current action.

### Customization

- **Theming:** Allow for easy customization and theming of the `Loader`. Ensure the component is styled using utility classes that can be easily adjusted.
- **Component Overrides:** Provide options to override specific styles or components within the `Loader` to cater to unique use cases without compromising the overall design integrity.

### Example CSS

Here is the CSS used for styling the `Loader` component, incorporating the styles and utilities from your global CSS:

```css
.flex-center {
  @apply flex justify-center items-center;
}
.w-full {
  @apply w-full;
}

```
