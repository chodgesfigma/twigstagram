## Styling Guidelines

When implementing the components in Twigstagram, it is important to adhere to certain style guidelines to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the application. Below are some recommended style guidelines:

### Consistency

- **Colors:** Use the defined color palette for all elements in the components. Ensure that the colors match the overall theme of the application.
- **Typography:** Use the `Inter` font family, as specified in your global CSS. Apply appropriate text classes for consistent typography.

### Spacing and Alignment

- **Padding and Margin:** Maintain consistent padding and margin values. Use utility classes to ensure the components look balanced.
- **Alignment:** Ensure that all elements are properly aligned, both horizontally and vertically.

### Responsiveness

- **Mobile-Friendly:** The components should be fully responsive and work well on various screen sizes.
- **Viewport Width:** Make sure the components span the appropriate width for their context.

### Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that the components are accessible via keyboard navigation.
- **Aria Labels:** Use appropriate ARIA labels for the buttons and inputs to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- **Contrast:** Maintain sufficient contrast between the text and the background color to ensure readability.

### Interactions

- **Hover and Focus States:** Define clear hover and focus states for interactive elements. Use utility classes to style these states.
- **Active State:** Highlight the active or selected state to indicate the current action.

### Customization

- **Theming:** Allow for easy customization and theming of the components. Ensure the components are styled using utility classes that can be easily adjusted.
- **Component Overrides:** Provide options to override specific styles or components to cater to unique use cases without compromising the overall design integrity.


## Testing

Twigstagram uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing. Below are the steps to run the tests and ensure the application functions correctly.

### Running Tests

 **Run All Tests:**
   ```sh
   npm test
```
**Run Tests with Coverage:**
```
npm run test:coverage
```
**Watch Mode:**
```
npm run test:watch
```
### Writing Tests

Unit Tests: Focus on testing individual components and functions.
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between multiple components.
End-to-End Tests: Ensure the entire application works as expected.

### Example Test

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';
import Bottombar from '@/components/shared/Bottombar';

test('renders Bottombar component', () => {
  render(<Bottombar />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/Home/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## Figma Design

Twigstagram utilizes Figma for UI/UX design, allowing for collaborative design development and prototyping. Below is a guide on how to access the Figma files associated with the project and how to utilize them effectively.

### Accessing Figma Files

1. **Figma Project Link:** 
   [Twigstagram Figma Files](https://www.figma.com/file/YOUR_FIGMA_FILE_ID/Twigstagram) - Access the main Figma file here. Make sure to request access if you are not part of the project yet.

2. **Request Access:**
   If you do not have access, contact the project manager or the design lead to be added to the Figma project.

### Using Figma

- **Collaboration:** Figma is a powerful tool for teams to collaborate in real time. Utilize the commenting feature to provide feedback directly on the design.

- **Prototyping:** Use Figma to create interactive prototypes to demonstrate and test user flows and interactions. This is especially useful for understanding how users will interact with the new features being developed.

- **Inspect Mode:** Developers can use Figma’s inspect mode to get CSS code snippets, export assets, and understand layout measurements.

### Guidelines for Using Figma

- **Consistency:** Ensure that you adhere to the established design tokens and styles specified in the Figma file. This includes colors, typography, spacing, and component styles.

- **Assets:** Export assets directly from Figma for use in the development. Ensure you select the correct format and resolution for web usage.

- **Component Libraries:** Make use of the component libraries in Figma to maintain consistency across the entire application. Always check if a component exists before creating a new one to avoid redundancy.

### Design Review

- **Regular Syncs:** Hold regular design review meetings with designers and developers to ensure alignment and discuss any potential issues in translating designs into code.

- **Feedback Loop:** Establish a clear feedback loop where developers can provide input on design feasibility and designers can adapt designs to meet technical requirements.

### Updating Designs

- **Version Control:** Figma files should be managed with version control in mind. Use Figma’s version history feature to keep track of changes and updates.

- **Communication:** Communicate any changes in design promptly to the development team. Use channels like Slack or email to notify team members of updates.
