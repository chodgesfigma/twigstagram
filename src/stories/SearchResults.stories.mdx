# SearchResults Component

The `SearchResults` component is used to display search results in the Twigstagram application. It shows a loader while fetching data, displays the search results in a grid format, or shows a message if no results are found.


## Usage

To use the `SearchResults` component in your project, you can import it and use it with the desired props. Below is an example of how to include it in your application.

```jsx
import { Models } from 'appwrite'
import Loader from './Loader';
import GridPostList from './GridPostList';

type SearchResultsProps = {
  isSearchFetching: boolean;
  searchedPosts: Models.Document[];
}

const SearchResults = ({ isSearchFetching, searchedPosts }: SearchResultsProps) => {
  if(isSearchFetching) return <Loader />

  if(searchedPosts && searchedPosts.documents.length > 0) return (
    <GridPostList posts={searchedPosts.documents} />
  );

  return (
    <p className="text-light-4 mt-10 text-center w-full">No results found</p>
  )
}

export default SearchResults;
```

## Style Guidelines

When implementing the `SearchResults` component, it is important to adhere to certain style guidelines to maintain a consistent look and feel throughout the application. Below are some recommended style guidelines:

### Consistency

- **Colors:** Use the defined color palette for all elements in the `SearchResults`. Ensure that the colors match the overall theme of the application.
- **Typography:** Use the `Inter` font family, as specified in your global CSS. Apply appropriate text classes for consistent typography.

### Spacing and Alignment

- **Padding and Margin:** Maintain consistent padding and margin values. Use utility classes to ensure the `SearchResults` looks balanced.
- **Alignment:** Ensure that all elements within the `SearchResults` are properly aligned, both horizontally and vertically.

### Responsiveness

### Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that the `SearchResults` is accessible via keyboard navigation.
- **Aria Labels:** Use appropriate ARIA labels for the loader and search results to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- **Contrast:** Maintain sufficient contrast between the text and the background color to ensure readability.

### Interactions

- **Hover and Focus States:** Define clear hover and focus states for interactive elements. Use utility classes to style these states.
- **Active State:** Highlight the active or selected state to indicate the current action.

### Customization

- **Theming:** Allow for easy customization and theming of the `SearchResults`. Ensure the component is styled using utility classes that can be easily adjusted.
- **Component Overrides:** Provide options to override specific styles or components within the `SearchResults` to cater to unique use cases without compromising the overall design integrity.
